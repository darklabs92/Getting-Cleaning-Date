# Course Project
Herein, we were tasked with performing 5 different (cleaning & tidying) jobs on data generated by 30 subjects' Samsung Galaxy S wearables. 
The data set for the the same can be found at -

I have hardcoded the file paths as I found it a bit tough to manipulate the different data sets via the .zip file itself (different data is at different levels).

Thus, I placed the unzipped file at C:\Users\yourname\Documents\R\
My run_analysis.R is also at the same location.

The final, tidy output is a file, called tidyDat.csv, of the following dimensions 78*181 (180 columns = 6 activities * 30 subj.)

Thanks for giving my work a look.
